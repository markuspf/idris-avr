Idris AVR Code Generator
--------------------------

This is a code generator for Idris that targets ATMega chips.

At the moment I am targetting the ATMEGA328p.

It's based on the excellent empty code generator by Edwin Brady and my experiences
making the GAP backend and the idris-c-boehm backend, and my experiences programming
for the ATMega328p.
